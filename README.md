# Analyze A/B Test Results
## Summary
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. This project is aimed to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Files used
* ab_data.csv
* countries.csv

## Workflow

### PART I probability
* This part focused on data wrangling and calculation of the probability of the total probability of conversion as well as the probability given the old page or the new page

### PART II A/B test
* This section focused on hypotesis testing to establish if the new page statistically improves the conversion rate

### Regression
* This section uses Logistic Regression to ask the same question. Additionally the countries associated to each users are evaluated in the model.
